    "The results may be a bit underwhelming after 30 epochs of training. We can notice that most of the headlines make some kind of grammatical sense, but don't necessarily indicate a good contextual understanding. The results might improve somewhat by running more epochs. You can do this by runnning the training fit cell again (and again!) to train another 30 epochs each time. You should see the loss value go down. Then try the tests again. Results can vary quite a bit!\n",
